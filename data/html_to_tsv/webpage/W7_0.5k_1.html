                        public. Using the <a>1Password password manager</a>
                        helps you ensure all your passwords are strong and unique such that a breach of one service
                        doesn't put your other services at risk.

                                        data breach</a>. The incident exposed almost 15 million unique email addresses
                                    alongside names, usernames, genders, dates of birth and either an MD5 or bcrypt
                                    password hash. In 2019, <a>the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web

                                        suffered a data breach</a> which impacted 18 million accounts. In their

                                    account, which was not secured using two-factor authentication". Salted SHA-1

                                    and online gaming accounts known as Abusewith.us suffered multiple data breaches.
                                    The site <a>allegedly had an administrator in common with the nefarious LeakedSource
                                        site</a>, both of which have since been shut down. The exposed data included

                                    of which were subsequently leaked on a popular hacking forum. Although usage of the

                                    demand was allegedly rejected and data containing 5.4M unique email addresses was
                                    subsequently dumped publicly on a popular hacking forum the next month. The data

                                    Employee data was also dumped publicly and included salary grades, marital statuses

                                        database containing billions of data points publicly exposed without a
                                        password</a>. The data was discovered by security researcher <a>Vinny Troia</a>
                                    who subsequently sent a subset of the data containing 126 million unique email
                                    addresses to Have I Been Pwned. The data left exposed by Apollo was used in their
                                    "revenue acceleration platform" and included personal information such as names and
                                    email addresses as well as professional information including places of employment,
                                    the roles people hold and where they're located. Apollo stressed that the exposed
                                    data did not include sensitive information such as passwords, social security
                                    numbers or financial data. <a>The Apollo website has a contact form</a> for those
