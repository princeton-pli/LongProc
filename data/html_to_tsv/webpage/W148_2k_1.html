It started as a tool specially tailored for teaching how to test software, but can be very well used in other scenarios. The current version supports the testing of methods based on control flow graph coverage criteria. Its suits well the teaching of software testing classes, because of its careful designed UI and its smoothly integration with the Eclipse IDE. The testing concepts are well organized: a view for the control flow graph (automatically generated from the method's source code), a view with the supported coverage criteria arranged in such a way that it is easy to visualize which criteria subsumes others, a view for manipulating test requirements and its explanation both in terms of the control flow graph and of the source code, a view for the test paths, another for coverage statistics, yet another for data flow information, and all these views integrated together to give as much information as possible to the test engineer. It provides integration with JUnit and reconstructs run paths of each test method, computing statistics either for each test method or for the complete test set. PESTT distinguishes from other coverage analysis testing tools because it is not just a node and branch coverage analyzer. Among other things, it supports many other "more powerful" coverage criteria and assists the test engineer in the various tasks of the testing activity.</p><p><b>Web Site</b>: <a>http://pestt.github.com</a><br/>
