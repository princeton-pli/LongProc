<p>For centuries, the Demon Slayer Corps has sacredly kept the location of Swordsmith Village a secret. As the village of the greatest forgers, it provides Demon Slayers with the finest weapons, which allow them to fight night-crawling fiends and ensure the safety of humans. After his sword was chipped and deemed useless, Tanjirou Kamado, along with his precious little sister Nezuko, is escorted to the village to receive a new one.

Meanwhile, the death of an Upper Rank Demon disturbs the idle order in the demon world. As Tanjirou becomes acquainted with Mist Hashira Muichirou Tokitou and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, ferocious powers creep from the shadows and threaten to shatter the Demon Slayers' greatest line of defense.

<p>In the entertainment world, celebrities often show exaggerated versions of themselves to the public, concealing their true thoughts and struggles beneath elaborate lies. Fans buy into these fabrications, showering their idols with undying love and support, until something breaks the illusion. Sixteen-year-old rising star Ai Hoshino of pop idol group B Komachi has the world captivated; however, when she announces a hiatus due to health concerns, the news causes many to become worried.

As a huge fan of Ai, gynecologist Gorou Amemiya cheers her on from his countryside medical practice, wishing he could meet her in person one day. His wish comes true when Ai shows up at his hospital—not sick, but pregnant with twins! While the doctor promises Ai to safely deliver her children, he wonders if this encounter with the idol will forever change the nature of his relationship with her.

<p>Sentenced to death, ninja Gabimaru the Hollow finds himself apathetic. After leading a blood-soaked life, Gabimaru believes he deserves to die. However, every attempt to execute him inexplicably fails. Finally, Sagiri Yamada Asaemon, a fledgling member of a famed executioner clan, is asked to take Gabimaru's life; yet Sagiri makes no move to kill him as requested.

Insisting that Gabimaru will not die because of his love for his wife, Sagiri instead offers him the chance to obtain a full pardon for his crimes. If he can travel to the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of Life—which supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then his freedom will be assured.

But of the many who have traveled to Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a single person has returned sound of mind, if at all. Though unaware of the numerous dangers ahead, Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten other death row convicts—in hope that he and his wife may finally live in peace.

<p>In this magical world, one is easily identified as having magical abilities by a distinctive mark on their face. Those unable to practice magic are swiftly exterminated to maintain the magical integrity of society. However, deep within a forest lies an anomaly in Mash Burnedead, who can be found pumping iron with one arm and lifting a cream puff with the other. This aloof boy with superhuman strength—but no magical abilities—leads a quiet life with his father, far removed from society.

Mash's peace is soon disturbed when the authorities discover his lack of magical powers. They issue him an ultimatum: compete to become a "Divine Visionary," which would force everyone to accept him, or be persecuted forever. To protect his family, he enrolls in the prestigious Easton Magic Academy, which only the most elite and gifted students are allowed to attend. Now, Mash must overcome his shortcomings as a magicless being and surpass the other students—relying solely on his muscles.

Amid this turmoil, an isolated facility shelters children and nurtures them in peace. However, as a few among them find out about the world beyond the narrow periphery of their nursery's walls, their curiosity about it slowly grows.

Meanwhile, in the outside world, young survivors Maru and Kiruko band together to search for a special place called Heaven, each for their own reasons. Carrying past burdens and tragic secrets, the two hope to find answers to the cruelty they have experienced in their lives and in the world, which still remains in tatters.

<p>All his life, Yuuya Tenjou has been the subject of resentment and contempt from everyone around him, even from his parents. To make matters worse, his grandfather—the only person who ever showed him affection—suddenly dies, leaving Yuuya truly alone.

Despite facing many adversities, Yuuya does what he can to offer kindness to those who need it—but even the most good-natured people can only tolerate so much abuse. Just when he reaches his breaking point, a flicker of hope appears in the form of a hidden door in his bathroom.

This door provides two-way access to an abandoned house in another world, where he instantly gains game-like stats and skills. Moreover, the house once belonged to a sage, which gives Yuuya access to remarkable weapons, equipment, and crops with extraordinary effects. With these newfound blessings, the once-undesirable Yuuya may just reach his true potential and become unstoppable.

<p>Apprentice mage Chise Hatori is invited to enroll at the College, a prestigious learning institution for sorcerers, to examine and look for a way to remove the curses she bears. Despite her groom Elias Ainsworth's reluctance, Chise accepts the proposal, as she believes attending the school might help her minimize her self-sacrificing tendencies.

From the get-go, Chise grabs the attention of her classmates and professors alike, who have never seen a mage in action before. However, there is a sinister plot brewing behind the College's back, and the young mage will have to determine who is friend or foe in order to put a stop to it.

<p>Kyoutarou Ichikawa may look like a shy and reserved middle school student, but deep within his heart is a bloodthirsty killer. His ultimate desire is to see his classmate Anna Yamada's beautiful face writhing in pain before he ends her life. But this fantasy may never come to fruition, as Ichikawa starts to see an entirely different side to Yamada.

Often seeking refuge in the library, Ichikawa frequently runs into Yamada. It is during these encounters that Ichikawa realizes his model classmate is actually an airhead who can never read the room. As they spend more time together, the boy cannot help but feel not only a sense of endearment toward the very girl he wishes to murder but also a desire to protect her at all costs. Is it possible that this sudden change in Ichikawa's perspective could lead to something more?

<p>Under the belief that the omnipotent god Mitama will come to save him, Yukito Urabe participates in a ritual to become the new leader of his father's cult. But when the boy drowns during the ritual, he wishes to be reborn in a world without gods or religion.

Reawakening in a completely different world devoid of spirituality. He meets a deviant girl named Aruaru, who introduces him to her village. However, his idyllic image of this world's society is short-lived when he witnesses a public group suicide and learns of the country's end-of-life system: at any moment, the government may order any citizen to die.

Aruaru and her sister are forcibly taken for execution soon after, prompting Yukito to rush to their rescue—but to no avail. In a moment of desperation, Yukito recalls his father's teachings and utters a prayer for Mitama to save them. Seemingly answering his call, a little girl descends from the sky and annihilates everyone who harmed Yukito and his friends. To Yukito's surprise, the girl introduces herself as Mitama.

<p>Touya Mochizuki grows accustomed to his new life in another world. Armed with his trusty smartphone, the teenager accepts small quests at his leisure while spending time with his new fiancées: Yumina Urnea Belfast, Yae Kokonoe, and twin sisters Linse and Elze Shileska. But even in a relaxing environment, Touya is only beginning to understand the responsibilities that come with these engagements.

In addition to his romantic woes, the elder fairy Lean wishes to locate the remaining pieces of Babylon, the floating island that the mysterious Professor Regina Babylon created five thousand years ago. Touya reluctantly accepts her request and seeks out the teleportation circles that will lead to the islands. However, strange monsters have emerged—possibly powerful enough to destroy the world. In order to save the second life he was given, Touya must weaponize ancient technologies to fight these monsters—all while balancing his overwhelming number of relationships.

<p>On his way to a convenience store, Kazuya Shiina tries to defend two young girls from an armed assailant, only to end up getting stabbed himself and dying on the spot. This good deed allows him to be reborn with all his memories in another world as Cain von Silford, the third son of a margrave.

When Cain turns five, a baptismal ceremony in the church grants him an audience to the seven gods who preside over the world. Not only do the gods fill him in on the circumstances of his reincarnation, but they also give Cain their respective divine protections—allowing him to use cheat-like abilities in swordsmanship, magic, and many other aspects.

With these blessings, Cain sets out to live a fulfilling life that he deems a dream come true. However, it soon becomes clear that the gods have more plans for him than just a haphazard bestowal of overwhelming power.

<p>When, after her sudden death, Rinko Hanasaki is reborn as Raeliana McMillan, she is not sure whether to curse her luck. Raeliana was a minor character in a novel Rinko read, and as the eldest daughter of a nouveau-riche baron, she led a carefree life until her unfortunate demise at the hands of her fiancé, Lord Francis Brooks. To avoid her destined fate, Raeliana is determined to end her engagement with Francis.

However, when Francis refuses to break things off, Raeliana decides to seek help from someone of higher standing and approaches Duke Noah Wynknight—the novel's male protagonist. Using her knowledge of the plot, Raeliana captures the duke's interest by proposing a deal: she will not expose his secrets if Noah agrees to act as her fiancé. Little does she know that getting involved with a duke who only shows his true colors around her may lead to more than she bargained for.

<p>Far to the north of the world lies Hell's Gate, a portal formerly used by the Demon Lord to invade the human realm. Thanks to the legendary hero Shion Bladearts, wielder of Excalibur, and his loyal band of companions, the Gate was sealed off and the demonic threat was vanquished.

Unfortunately, the seal was incomplete and has begun to weaken, allowing the demons to once again begin their attack. Worried about the safety of his village, selfish and perverted farmer Touka Scott dig pitfalls to defend against the demons. But fear not, for Shion is on his way to reseal Hell's Gate and save humanity!

Or at least he was, because the legendary hero is dead, having fallen into one of the pitfalls Touka dug. Luckily, dealing with the dead is the specialty of necromancer Anri Haynesworth. While she can't revive him, Anri can at least salvage their quest by forcing Touka's soul into Shion's rotting body and dragging him along to Hell's Gate in Shion's place. Not wanting to be left behind, Touka's childhood friend Yuna Yunis tags along. Together, the three of them set out as what just might be the most unsuitable party to ever try to save the world!

<p>While saving a child from harm, otaku Asahi Ikusaba is transported to another world and believes he has reincarnated with cheat skills similar to those of the characters from his favorite games and novels. Unfortunately, reality strikes when an encounter with a powerful monster shows that he is still nothing more than an average person.

In this moment of extreme danger, Asahi instinctively calls out to his overly doting sister, Maya, who appears out of nowhere, possessing the overpowered abilities he thought he had. Maya is ecstatic to see her brother again and resolves to use her newfound powers to protect Asahi no matter what.

Together, the close-knit siblings attempt to find a way back home while enjoying their new lives. However, it soon becomes clear that their arrival in this world may have had a purpose. With the Demon King's overwhelmingly powerful army approaching, no one but Maya seems to be able to stand in its way.

<p>In 2008, the Japanese government began hunting people who identify as otaku in an effort to protect the country's culture. In just one week, the enforcement agency known as the SSC captured almost every otaku by force and confiscated their memorabilia. One passionate man calling himself Otaku Hero refuses to allow this agency to do as they please: he raises a resistance army made up of other displaced geeks who band together to help defend their culture.

Three years later, the fires of rebellion wane as all hope seems lost for otakus. Spurred on by his ally—the magical girl Anarchy—Otaku Hero commands the resistance in an effort to reunite Anarchy with the other two other magical girls: Blue and Pink. By combining the power of this trio, the resistance may be able to defeat the SSC and save otaku culture for everyone.

<p>After surviving a brutal terrorist attack on Plant Quetta, Suletta Mercury returns to dueling at the Asticassia School of Technology, while Miorine Rembran sits at her injured father's side, waiting to see if he will recover. As the residents of Earth House are preoccupied with their respective troubles, two members of Dawn of Fold—the perpetrators of the attack—secretly infiltrate the school, putting Suletta and her friends at risk.

At the same time, Prospera, Suletta's mother, approaches Miorine to propose the continuation of "Quiet Zero"—a project headed by Miorine's father that can allegedly end all war. Prospera seems to be another political figure with hidden, opposing motives, and whether she truly has Suletta's well-being at heart remains to be seen.

<p>Now in possession of the Edens Zero, Shiki Granbell has gathered the Four Shining Stars. With the help of his new friends, Shiki will be able to breach Dragonfall—the border of the Sakura Cosmos swarming with mechanical dragons. Once that is achieved, he can continue his quest to find the goddess Mother.

Before the Edens Zero crew can advance their journey, they notice a mysterious warship following them. Upon learning that the ship—the Belial Gore—belongs to Drakken Joe, Shiki and his crew attempt to infiltrate it, intent on figuring out why the Dark Alchemist is after them. In the process, the Edens Zero is taken hostage by Drakken's subordinates.

Though they are in a tight situation, Shiki refuses to back down. Working together with his friends, Shiki will have to take down the Dark Alchemist if he hopes to make it out of the Belial Gore alive.

<p>Akane Nishimura's quiet nature makes her classmates perceive her as a gloomy and unlikeable person. Combined with her intimidating gaze, it earns Akane the ominous nickname "Grim Reaper," condemning her to endless bullying for her supposed cursed powers that bring misfortune to everyone around her.

However, none of these rumors deter transfer student Taiyou Takada from trying to befriend Akane. As someone who finds the supernatural fascinating, Taiyou approaches the Grim Reaper without hesitation, blissfully unaware of the complicated situation within the class. His bright personality and optimistic worldview may just bring about the change that Akane desperately needs.

<p>Hajime Aono used to live for the sound of his violin playing. Ever since he was young, he had admired his world-renowned violinist father, who inspired him to pick up the instrument himself. But following his parents' bitter divorce, Aono swears to never play again and heads for high school without a direction or a prospect.

During a physical education class, the unathletic Aono gets struck in the face with a ball and ends up in the infirmary. There, he meets the brash Ritsuko Akine who begins to play the violin in the room, believing she is alone. However, following a past incident, there have been rumors claiming that Akine is a bully, which has isolated her from her peers—a fact Aono was unaware of.

Akine dreams of enrolling in a school with an orchestra, but her amateurish playing and lack of musical knowledge grates on Aono immensely. Seeing this as a perfect opportunity for the two to become friends, their teacher suggests that Aono teaches Akine how to play the violin, something Aono is vehemently against. However, as the pair spends more time together, they soon learn to understand and help each other—and Aono may finally discover the lost passion and melody in his life.

<p>Hime Shiraki appears to have it all: an angelic voice, an innocent personality, and an adorable face that enamors all onlookers. However, her cuteness is all a lie—it is purely an act to achieve her self-centered goal of marrying a rich suitor. Though she often plays up her innocence to gain favor from those around her, Hime's facade does not absolve her of responsibility when an accident leaves Mai Koshiba injured.

Learning that Mai is the manager of Café Liebe—a cafe themed as an all-girls academy—Hime is coerced into taking up a part-time position until Mai recovers. However, Hime's facade cannot cover up her shortcomings at being a waitress, earning her the ire of one of her coworkers, Mitsuki Yano, the elegant "onee-sama" who often berates Hime over her mistakes. As Hime struggles to adjust to her new job in addition to Mitsuki's unrelenting hostility, her real personality begins seeping through the cracks.

<p>For more than four hundred years, the Takamimi Shrine has stood in Tokyo, enshrining the local goddess: Elda, a magical elf summoned from another world. The immortal elf has been served for 15 generations by the family who summoned her in the Edo period. Now, after Koito Koganei turns 16 years old, this responsibility falls onto her.

Serving as Elda's shrine maiden, Koito must balance her responsibilities with her daily school life. This proves to be difficult because Elda is a total social recluse who loves video games, collecting toys, and eating snacks. In an effort to get the lazy shut-in to experience more of the outside world, Koito juggles her time between indulging Elda's various hobbies and getting her to interact with the rest of humanity. Along the way, Koito learns more about the history of the area and what makes the goddess so loved and spoiled by the locals.

<p>Located at the end of the world, the Kingdom of Ozmargo is inhabited by beasts of all shapes and forms, ruled by a fearsome nameless king. After a hundred-year war between Ozmargo and the neighboring human kingdom ended, a peace treaty was signed: every year, a sacrifice must be sent to be devoured by the king on the night of revelation.

Sariphi is the 99th and latest human sacrifice. Although frail-looking, she neither fears the king nor has a family or home to return to should she manage to escape from her impending demise. Intrigued by the audacious girl, the king lets Sariphi roam around the palace despite the disapproval of his advisor, Anubis.

Little by little, the king and Sariphi begin to warm up to each other, but the night of revelation is fast approaching. Unbeknownst to them, the fateful day unleashes a series of events that will change the course of destiny of not only Sariphi and the king but also of their respective worlds.

<p>Tousuke Rokudou is a first-year attending Aomori High, a school full of delinquents. He is often bullied by his classmates due to his incompatibility with their behavior, the only exceptions being his two good friends who are also social outcasts. Frustrated at the way they are treated, the three wish they could stand up and claim the fun, peaceful school life of their dreams.

However, Tousuke's life takes a drastic turn when he receives a package from his late grandfather containing their family heirloom, a scroll said to possess the power to save him from impending danger. Upon holding the scroll, a sudden glow emanates, leaving a strange mark on Tousuke's forehead.

Thinking that he's received the means to free himself and his friends from their daily treatment, Tousuke is shocked to find out that its effects are far different than what he had imagined. Although his bullying continues, he realizes that the mark from the scroll acts as a charm, capturing the hearts of delinquent girls—in particular, Ranna Himawari, the strongest of them all.

<p>Foolhardy police officer Brian Nightraider is dismissed from the force for a history of reckless behavior that ultimately resulted in his partner's death. While wallowing in self-pity, the disgraced officer receives a curious invitation from the United Nations Immigration Bureau Special Investigation Unit. He has been recruited to join the Marginal Service, a secret underground branch of the UN tasked with handling Borderlanders.

Indistinguishable from humans, Borderlanders are aliens that peacefully coexist in society. But now, a Borderlander terrorist organization has emerged, manufacturing and distributing a potent drug called Confu. With the Borderlanders' ability to regenerate and blend in as humans, uncovering the drug-trafficking ring will be no easy undertaking. However, the ragtag group at the Marginal Service are not one to back down from a challenge—even as their work exposes some unexpected figures as Borderlanders.

<p>Once shunned by the art world, Perception Art has taken the world by storm. The medium has evolved to incorporate all five senses, allowing viewers to completely immerse themselves in pieces of art. As the son of the creators of this movement, Kazuya Yamanashi has inherited his late parents' talent and creativity for Perception Art. Now enrolled at Eisen High School, the first-year has his sights set on becoming the best Perception Artist.

Kazuya has a reason besides ambition to attend this prestigious institution, as he hopes to make amends with his estranged childhood friend, third-year student Kyou Takise. But the rift between them may be difficult to repair since Kyou and Kazuya belong to different streams of study at the school.

As luck would have it, the two are partnered for the exclusive Staircaser competition, in which the winners will represent Eisen for the year. In order to stand a chance against their competitors, Kazuya and Kyou will have to learn to set aside their differences first.

<p>Centuries ago, mankind abandoned planet Earth after the Vice, a race of mechanical aliens, drove them from their home into a life adrift in space. Now resigned to starships forged of pieces of Earth’s shattered moon, the final hope for humanity lies in the hands of Actresses, young women born with the ability to wield the only weapons that can harm the Vice: Alice Gears, mechanical suits that can finally turn the tide against the alien incursion.
